HTML-FormatExternal lets you turn HTML into plain text using one of
the browsing/formatting programs,

    elinks        http://elinks.cz/
    html2text     http://www.mbayer.de/html2text/
    links         http://links.twibright.com/
    lynx          http://lynx.isc.org/
    netrik        http://netrik.sourceforge.net/
    vilistextum   http://bhaak.dyndns.org/vilistextum/
    w3m           http://sourceforge.net/projects/w3m
    zen           http://www.nocrew.org/software/zen/

The programming interface is compatible with HTML::FormatText and
HTML::FormatText::WithLinks, so you can fairly easily switch how you
want the formatting done.

The programs vary in things like link printing style, levels of
support for non-ascii input or output, table output, or HTML 4
constructs.  The compatible programming interface means you can give a
couple of them a try to find what you like most or are most familiar
with etc.
