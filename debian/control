# Build-Depends could have the "maximum_tests" modules from META.yml
# for more tests, but they're optional author tests really and would
# just make the build tools drag in more stuff.
#   
# Build-Depends could have "libhtml-tree-perl" could for
# HTML::TreeBuilder used by a couple of tests.  The formatter programs
# are used by the tests likewise.  But demanding all that is a bit
# tedious for a manual build, and in particular "zen" is not in debian
# as of Feb 2009.
